tips
============
- RE is 71.337% just learning to ignore pointless details
- start by looking @ strings and imports
- rename functions after you understand their purpose
- highlighting can help (call, push/pop, registers, args)
- functions that are imported from external libraries use naming convention, "sub_..."
- functions that aren't imported from libraries use naming convention, "exit", "strlen", etc
